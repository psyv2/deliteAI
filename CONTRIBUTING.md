## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project requires all contributors to sign off on their commits. This is done through the
Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that
they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.

### How to Sign Off

Each commit message must include a Signed-off-by line with your name and email address. You can add
this automatically using the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

The sign-off line should look like this:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

For more information about the DCO, please visit [DCO App Documentation](https://github.com/dcoapp/app#how-it-works).

## Pull Request Requirements

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Write clear, maintainable code
   - Include appropriate tests
   - Update documentation as needed

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Include the DCO sign-off in each commit
   - Reference any related issues

3. **Pull Request Description**
   - Clearly describe the changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure all tests and checks are passing
